Any fraudulent activity, as determined at Naijalottery ´s sole discretion, is strictly prohibited. Fraudulent activity may include, but is not limited to, stolen credit cards, transfer of funds to other player accounts (chip dumping), forgery, collusion, the provision of false registration data or other requested information. In addition to any other remedies provided under the general terms and conditions or the applicable game rules, Naijalottery reserves the right to pursue claims for criminal prosecution and/or civil damages for any fraudulent activities. For this purpose, Naijalottery furthermore reserves the right to record telephone calls with customers in order to pass on to third parties for the purpose of prosecution. Any player/customer involved in any form of suspected fraudulent activity and any suspicious transaction will be reported to the appropriate authorities.\r\n\r\n4) Furthermore, it is unlawful to deposit funds obtained from ill-gotten means on the Naijalottery Account. Naijalottery will check all transactions to prevent money laundering and funding of terrorist activities. Suspicious transactions will be reported to the authorities in charge.\r\nAny decision of Naijalottery regarding the invalidation of transactions shall be binding upon the player/customer and lies within the sole discretion of Naijalottery and may not be contested by the player/customer. In case of any irregularities in payment transactions as described in 1) to 4) above or in case of reasonable suspicions concerning the violation of any rules governing gaming or betting at Naijalottery  (i.e. these General Terms and Conditions, the rules of the game and specific rules as applicable) Naijalottery  may at its sole discretion, declare the transactions concerned invalid.\r\n\r\nIn every case, Naijalottery reserves the right to hold/charge costs which can occur after each procedure (transaction fees, court costs etc.).\r\n\r\nDeposits made to your Naijalottery account should be played one (1) time in odds 1.80 (per event) and more before you can request a withdrawal (e.g. If you deposit 10 Niara, your total betting cost should be at least 10 Naira in odds 1.80 (per event) and more in order to request withdrawal). The bets with odds less than 1,80 (per event) will not count for the deposit rollover. (The bet/bet slip that contains selections of Draw No Bet/ Handicap / Cashout and Postponed matches do not count for deposit rollover).\r\n\r\nTherefore, if in Naijalottery discretion, there is suspicion of abuse (for instance, where a deposited amount has not been used for an appropriate level of gameplay and the user then makes a withdrawal request in relation to that deposited amount), Naijalottery reserves the right in its absolute discretion to cancel the respective deposit(s) in part or in full, to retract any costs that may have resulted in conjunction therewith and to close the Naijalottery account indefinitely.\r\n\r\nNaijalottery further reserves the right to request and obtain satisfactory proof of deposit and additional copies of personal identification in such instances prior to processing any withdrawal request, the processing of such request to be entirely at Naijalottery 's discretion\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script> \r\nimport Navigation from \"@/components/Landing/Navigation.vue\";
